PySeqLab
=========

``PySeqLab`` is an open source package for performing supervised learning in structured prediction tasks. 
It implements conditional random fields (CRFs) models from (1) first-order to higher-order linear-chain CRFs, and from (2) first-order to higher-order semi-Markov CRFs (semi-CRFs).
