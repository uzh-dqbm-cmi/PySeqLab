PySeqLab
========

PySeqLab is an open source package for performing supervised learning in structured prediction tasks. It implements most known implementations of conditional random fields (CRFs), that is discriminative models from (1) first-order to higher-order linear-chain CRFs, and from (2) first-order to higher-order semi-Markov CRFs (semi-CRFs).
